# 60. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components & Stateless vs Stateful Components

When ever we create two way binding, passing a value to a parent component through a function, and then setting the value on the component itself through props passed from the parent, we call that a Controlled component.

Components that do not manage State and only display some data, are called dumb or presentational components.
